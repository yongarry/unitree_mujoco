# Introduction
## Unitree mujoco
`unitree_mujoco` is a simulator developed based on `Unitree sdk2` and `mujoco`. Users can easily integrate the control programs developed with `Unitree_sdk2`, `unitree_ros2`, and `unitree_sdk2_python` into this simulator, enabling a seamless transition from simulation to physical development. The repository includes two versions of the simulator implemented in C++ and Python, with a structure as follows:

## Supported Unitree sdk2 Messages:
**Current version only supports low-level development, mainly used for sim to real verification of controller**
- `LowCmd`: Motor control commands
- `LowState`: Motor state information
- `SportModeState`: Robot position and velocity data
- `IMUState`: Torso IMU state at `rt/secondary_imu` topic (G1 only)
